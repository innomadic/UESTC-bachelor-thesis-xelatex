@article{Goh2008,
	__Markedentry = {[richard:6]},
	Abstract = {{The dynamics of a wide range of real systems, from email patterns
	to earthquakes, display a bursty, intermittent nature, characterized
	by short timeframes of intense activity followed by long times of
	no or reduced activity. The understanding of the origin of such bursty
	patterns is hindered by the lack of tools to compare different systems
	using a common framework. Here we propose to characterize the bursty
	nature of real signals using orthogonal measures quantifying two
	distinct mechanisms leading to burstiness: the interevent time distribution
	and the memory. We find that while the burstiness of natural phenomena
	is rooted in both the interevent time distribution and memory, for
	human dynamics memory is weak, and the bursty character is due to
	the changes in the interevent time distribution. Finally, we show
	that current models lack in their ability to reproduce the activity
	pattern observed in real systems, opening up avenues for future work.}},

@article{Zhou2007,
	Abstract = {We present a link rewiring mechanism to produce surrogates of a network
	where both the degree distribution and the rich-club connectivity
	are preserved. We consider three real networks, the autonomous system
	(AS)-Internet, protein interaction and scientific collaboration.
	We show that for a given degree distribution, the rich-club connectivity
	is sensitive to the degree--degree correlation, and on the other hand
	the degree--degree correlation is constrained by the rich-club connectivity.
	In particular, in the case of the Internet, the assortative coefficient
	is always negative and a minor change in its value can reverse the
	network's rich-club structure completely; while fixing the degree
	distribution and the rich-club connectivity restricts the assortative
	coefficient to such a narrow range, that a reasonable model of the
	Internet can be produced by considering mainly the degree distribution
	and the rich-club connectivity. We also comment on the suitability
	of using the maximal random network as a null model to assess the
	rich-club connectivity in real networks.},
